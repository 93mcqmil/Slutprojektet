      <h1>About Open Library</h1>
      <p>
        Open Library is a database of over two million digitized books,
        including classic and public-domain texts, as well as a growing
        collection of books of all kinds donated by libraries around the
        country. Books can be downloaded or read online. Open Library's
        browser-based reader lets you flip through scanned pages, preserving the
        experience of a printed book, but keyword-searching in the text is also
        supported. To find books – fiction or nonfiction, juvenile or adult, on
        all subjects and in a variety of languages – visit the homepage to get
        started:
        <a href='https://openlibrary.org/subjects/in_library#ebooks=true'>
